* @par Purpose
* This function must be called by network driver to pass the input packet to LwIP.
*
* @par Description
* This function must be called by network driver to pass the input packet to LwIP.
* Before calling this API, the driver has to keep the packet in the pbuf structure. The driver must
* call pbuf_alloc() with the type as PBUF_RAM to create the pbuf structure. The driver
* has to pass the pbuf structure to this API to add the pbuf into the TCPIP thread.
* After this packet is processed by TCPIP thread, pbuf will be freed. The driver is not required to
* free the pbuf.
* @param[in]    netif                 Indicates the LwIP network interface.
* @param[in]    p                     Indicates the packet in the pbuf structure.
